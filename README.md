# oci-moodle-mds

Note: This is in development, has not been tested, but the objective is to upgrade Moodle to 4.5LTS and PHP 8.1 and add optional features for Redis caching and auto SSL

Deploy Moodle 4.5 on Oracle Cloud Intrastructure (OCI) and MySQL Database Service (MDS) using these Terraform modules.

The same modules are used as Resource Manager Stack.

The latest stack can be downloaded directly in the releases (the zip file)
